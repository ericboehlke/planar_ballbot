# Direct Collocation and Time-varying LQR on a Planar Ballbot

This project uses `pydrake` to find and execute a trajectory on a planar ballbot model.

The paper for this project is in this repo under [project_report.pdf](https://github.com/ericboehlke/planar_ballbot/blob/master/project_report.pdf) and the accompanying video can be found on YouTube [here.](https://youtu.be/pz973Jr5Y68)
